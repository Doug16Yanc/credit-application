#  System of credit application in Kotlin 💻


Public repository containing source code for the project of a credit application system in Kotlin language using the Spring Boot framework.


## Description 📄📃


The project uses of concepts object-oriented programming, relational databases and server application layering as services, repositories, controllers, data transfer objects, as well as a layer for handling exceptions arising from the probability of usability events of software. Like a good learning project, there are only two entities worked on, the customer and the credit, the latter associated with the first. In a cardinality relationship, a customer can have several credits, but a credit can only be associated with one customer. The API used was REST and the dependency manager was Maven, therefore, due to the need to test the REST API functionalities, the Postman request tester was used and from this, it was possible to handle absurd cases of exceptions such as in which case the customer has a credit request saved before registering it in the system, for example. Therefore, after usability testing, the system was designed to be integrated with any database management system as long as it is relational, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle DB or Microsoft SQL Server.There are cases for handling good information security practices, for example, when a client tries to access the data of a credit request from another client through the credit code generated by the UUID (Immutable universally unique identifier) library in Java , as it is registered in the database, the system finds it, but returns a cautionary message to the customer recommending that they consult with the administrator (not worked on so far, which could be a future possibility).

## Why Kotlin? ⁉️📜

For a long time, the Kotlin language was very well supported by mobile development, however, the advances made by it and its interoperability with the backend giant, Java, made software developers also turn their eyes and fingers to development backend in Kotlin using powerful and efficient frameworks from the Java world, such as Spring Boot, Micronaut and Quarkus. Furthermore, in addition to the concise syntax, Kotlin brings modern and academically discerned concepts such as null references and checked exceptions.
